Lispy
=====

Lispy is a Lisp implementation in Python. It is based on John
McCarthy's paper "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and
Their Computation by Machine, Part I", which can be found
[here](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive/); Common Lisp and
Clojure.

Some code is based on [fogus](http://github.com/fogus/)'s
[lithp](http://github.com/fogus/lithp).

Features
--------

Many.

Usage
-----

As of yet, there is no complete REPL for Lispy. To run a makeshift
REPL, run

    ./lispy.py
or
    python lispy.py

In order to evaluate code, enter an expression at the `=>` prompt and
press enter. The expression will be evaluated and its result
displayed.
